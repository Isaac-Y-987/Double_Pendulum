# Double Pendulum
Simmulates a double pendulum, which displays its dynamic behavior and chaotic properties.

Physics principles: Lagrangian mechanics, rotational dynamics, and nonlinear motion.

This project is one example of a chaotic system which shows how any small change in intial position creates a ripple effect leading to a completly different outcome.
